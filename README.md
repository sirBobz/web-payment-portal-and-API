# web-payment-portal-and-API
A web platform that can enable users to register and send money to each other within the system.

#Project overview
A client wants to build a web platform that can enable users to register and send money to each other within the system. 
They top up their accounts through MPESA* and can now transfer amongst themselves. 
They use the registered number or email address to transfer.  
Once a transfer is done, the recipient receives a notification in the system as well as a confirmation through email. 
A user should be able to trigger an email report summarising all the transaction they have done for a selected number of days. 
The users will use the application mostly on their phones so it should work well on a mobile browser.
